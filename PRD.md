# HealthCtx

HealthCtx (short for health context) is a place where the user can organize all their health and wellness related information and use AI to explore the data, ask questions, have the AI summarize and correlate information, and do research on the users behalf.

The user can upload bloodwork and medical test results, and the AI will automatically extract useful information and organize it in a comprehensible and easily accessible way. This allows the user to effortlessly track information over time. In addition to uploading documents, the user can also connect certain data sources, such as medical records or health and wellness trackers. Additionally the user can provide notes about medical history and conditions, which will be used to help the AI understand the user's health and provide better insights.

With all the information collected, the user can ask the AI to explain certain conditions, correlations, or research potential treatments that may exist. While users should use caution when using AI as an authoritative source of medical advice or diagnosis, AI has proven to be helpful in exploring medical information for people and helping them make sense of their health.

HealthCtx can be used to streamline the relationship between the user and their healthcare providers. The user can upload their medical records and share them with their healthcare providers, and the healthcare providers can use the information to better understand the user's health and provide better care. The AI can summarize the users health data and provide consice overview of the users information and history, reducing the need to capture all the information during visits, which can be particularly useful for establishing new patient relationships. AI can also help the user to organize talking points to make better use of limited time during doctor appointments.
