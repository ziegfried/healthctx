Below is a concise, end-to-end UI concept for HealthCtx with key screens, core interactions, and component breakdowns. I’ll outline each screen’s purpose, primary modules, and critical edge cases. If you want, I can follow up with wireframes or a component library spec.

1) Onboarding and Data Setup
Purpose: Get users’ data in quickly, set permissions, and calibrate AI context.

Key sections:
- Welcome + Value Proposition
  - Cards: “Import Results,” “Connect Sources,” “AI Insights,” “Share Securely”
- Account & Permissions
  - HIPAA/GDPR consent, data-processing purposes, sharing defaults
- Data Import
  - Upload: PDFs, images, CSV
  - Connectors: Apple Health, Google Fit, Epic/HL7/FHIR, device APIs (CGM, BP cuff, Oura, Fitbit, Garmin)
- Health Profile Seed
  - Conditions (taggable), medications (structured), allergies, surgeries, family history
  - Goals (e.g., sleep, weight, A1C, BP)
- AI Preferences
  - Tone options, caution level, evidence citation level, physician mode toggle
- Completion
  - Progress ring: “Data completeness” and “Signal richness” indicators

Edge cases:
- Partial connectors (read-only), missing FHIR scopes, PDF OCR failures with retry & manual field capture.

2) Home (Overview)
Purpose: Snapshot of health and quick access to actions.

Top bar:
- Profile switcher (e.g., self + dependent care)
- Data freshness indicator
- Quick actions: Upload, Connect, Ask AI, Share

Widgets (cards, reorderable):
- Health Summary
  - Vitals trend mini-charts: \( \text{BP}, \text{HR}, \text{Weight}, \text{Sleep}, \text{Steps}, \text{A1C/Lipids} \)
  - AI summary: “Notable changes in the last 14/90 days”
- Recent Imports & AI Extraction
  - Latest lab/test, extraction status, normalized entities with confidence badges
- Insights & Correlations
  - “Possible correlation: Sleep ↓ ↔ Resting HR ↑” with strength \( r \) and window
- Reminders & Prep
  - Upcoming appointment prep: talking points, doc-sharing checklist
- Care Team & Sharing
  - Active shares, quick revoke, invite
- Goals Progress
  - Goal cards with trend sparkline, adherence score

3) Data Ingestion & Normalization
Purpose: Handle file uploads and connected source imports.

Upload modal:
- Drag-and-drop + source picker
- Batch upload with progress
- OCR/extraction preview
- Field mapping: Lab -> LOINC mapping, units normalization with unit converter
- Confidence display
- Manual fix mode

Connector setup:
- OAuth flows with scopes
- Data preview before import
- Backfill range selection

Error handling:
- Conflict resolution (duplicate results)
- Unit mismatch detection and suggestions
- Privacy check: PHI redaction preview for share scenarios

4) Health Timeline
Purpose: Longitudinal view combining structured labs, vitals, notes, events.

Layout:
- Time navigator (Day/Week/Month/Year)
- Stream: Events (labs, tests, diagnoses, meds changes, surgeries, symptoms, notes, devices)
- Filters: Category, severity, source, confidence
- Compare mode: Overlay 2–3 metrics with aligned scales, highlight significant deltas
- AI Highlights toggle: Annotate spikes/outliers with contextual notes

Actions:
- Pin event, add note, link related items (e.g., med change to lab shift)
- Export time window as PDF/CSV

5) Labs & Results Explorer
Purpose: Deep-dive into labs with normalization and clinical ranges.

Header:
- Test family tabs: Metabolic, CBC, Lipids, Endocrine, Inflammation, etc.
- Search by test name/LOINC

Content:
- Test detail: reference range, patient-specific target range, unit, lab source
- Trend chart with flags for high/low, interventions, and relevant life events
- Cohort view: compare to population norms (opt-in, de-identified)
- AI explain:
  - “What does \( \text{TSH} \) measure?”
  - “Potential causes for elevated \( \text{ALT} \)?”
  - “What changed around the time \( \text{A1C} \) spiked?”

Utilities:
- Merge duplicate panels, adjust units, annotate fasting/non-fasting
- Attach documents

6) AI Console
Purpose: Chat and tools to reason over the user’s data with safety UX.

Components:
- Prompt area with mode chips:
  - Explain, Correlate, Research, Summarize, Prep for Doctor, Build Plan
- Context selector:
  - Time window, data sources, specific metrics/tests
- Citations panel:
  - Inline citations with jump-to-data and links to guidelines/studies
- Toolbelt:
  - Calculate risk scores (e.g., ASCVD) with explicit inputs
  - Generate talking points
  - Build follow-up checklist
- Guardrails:
  - Safety banner: “Not medical advice”
  - Encourage verification and physician discussion
  - Evidence quality badges

Examples:
- “Explain why \( \text{CRP} \) rose after 2025-01-10. Check sleep/activity and recent illness notes.”
- “Correlate \( \text{A1C} \) with weight and steps last 12 months.”
- “Summarize history for new endocrinology visit in under 200 words.”

7) Conditions & Medications
Purpose: Structured management of ongoing conditions and treatments.

Conditions list:
- Cards with status, control level, last review
- Condition detail:
  - Diagnostic criteria, key labs, targets
  - Tracked symptoms with severity sliders
  - Triggers & mitigations
  - Care plan tasks and adherence

Medications:
- Active + past meds, dosage, schedule, indications
- Interaction checker
- Adherence log (manual or device-linked)
- Side effects journal with AI correlation to labs/symptoms

8) Notes & Journaling
Purpose: Capture qualitative context that AI can leverage.

Editor:
- Rich text with templates: symptom log, food log, episode report
- Tags: condition, time, severity
- Voice note with transcription and entity extraction
- Privacy tiers: private, share-with-care-team, public link

AI assistance:
- Normalize free text into structured fields
- Suggest links to labs or events

9) Sharing & Care Team
Purpose: Secure, granular sharing and collaboration.

Share panel:
- Share target: email/phone/provider portal
- Scope: entire record, time-bounded window, specific categories
- Permissions: view, comment, upload, request data
- Watermarking/redaction options

Care team space:
- Provider view with clinical digest
- Comment threads on specific data points
- Visit packets:
  - Summary, meds, allergies, outstanding questions, recent trends
  - Export to PDF/FHIR bundle

10) Settings & Privacy
Purpose: Control, transparency, and governance.

Sections:
- Data sources & sync status
- Privacy & consent ledger (who accessed what, when)
- AI controls: evidence strictness, model transparency, PHI handling
- Notifications: reminders, anomaly alerts, data sync issues
- Backup & export: full export, selective export, account deletion

11) Alerts & Anomalies
Purpose: Surface important changes responsibly.

Examples:
- “Sustained elevated \( \text{BP} \) over 7 days”
- “Potential drug-lab interaction affecting \( \text{Potassium} \)”
- “Device sync stalls > 72h”
Settings:
- Thresholds, quiet hours, escalation preferences

12) Mobile Considerations
- Quick add note, quick upload scan
- Glanceable widgets for vitals and upcoming visits
- Offline drafts with later sync

13) Empty State UX
- Teach with examples, safe defaults, sample datasets
- Nudge to connect sources for richer insights

14) Accessibility & Trust
- Large tap targets, high contrast, screen reader-friendly labels
- Explainability drawer: “How this insight was formed,” with data slices
- Clear disclaimers on AI outputs, links to reputable sources

Design system highlights
- Tokens: spacing, color roles for normal/flagged/critical, confidence scale
- Components: TrendChart, LabCard, InsightChip, CorrelationBadge \( r \), ConfidencePill, ConsentTimeline, ShareScopePicker, EvidenceBadge, VisitPacketBuilder
- Microcopy: empathetic, precise, and cautionary where needed

User flows to prototype next
- Upload PDF lab → extraction review → normalized lab in Labs Explorer → AI explanation
- Connect EHR (FHIR) → consent scopes → import preview → timeline integration
- Build visit packet → share with provider → provider view feedback
- Ask AI to correlate 3 metrics → citations → export as summary

If you want wireframes, I can sketch them or produce a component JSON schema you can hand to design/engineering.
